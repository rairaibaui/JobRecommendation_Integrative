# How to View Applicants - IMPORTANT

## The Problem
You mentioned you can't see applicants who submitted applications. I've investigated and found:

1. ✅ **The application EXISTS in the database** (1 application from Alex Duhac)
2. ✅ **The backend code is working correctly**
3. ✅ **There was a JavaScript error preventing the view from working** (NOW FIXED)

## Solution - How to See Your Applicants

### Step 1: Log in with the CORRECT Employer Account
You need to log in as the employer who owns the job postings:

**Email:** `Yumikolorenzooooo@smart.com`  
**Name:** Angel Osana (Employer ID: 9)  
**Company:** Smart Grocery Store

This employer has:
- 2 job postings ("Senior Web Developer" and "Producer")
- 1 application waiting (for "Senior Web Developer" from Alex Duhac)

### Step 2: Navigate to Applicants Page
1. After logging in, click on **"Applicants"** in the sidebar

### Step 3: Expand the Job Card to See Applications
The applications are hidden inside collapsible job cards:

1. You'll see a list of your job postings
2. **CLICK ON THE JOB CARD** (anywhere on the card with the job title)
3. The card will expand and show:
   - Job description
   - Required skills
   - **List of applicants** with their profiles
4. Click the chevron icon to collapse it again

### What Was Fixed
I fixed a critical JavaScript error where:
- HTML code was mixed inside a JavaScript function
- This prevented the expand/collapse functionality from working
- The Interview Modal was placed incorrectly

The page should now work correctly!

## All Employer Accounts in Your Database

| ID | Name | Email | Company | Job Postings |
|----|------|-------|---------|--------------|
| 3 | Yumiko Lorenzo | YumikoSmartChoice@gmail.com | Smart Grocery Store | 0 |
| 5 | Yumiko Lorenzo | Yumikolorenzo5@smartchoice.com | Smart Grocery Store | 0 |
| 7 | Yumiko Lorenzo | Yumikolorenzooooo@smartchoice.com | Smart Grocery Store | 0 |
| 8 | Yumiko Lorenzo | Yumikolorenzooooo@smartch.com | Smart Grocery Store | 0 |
| **9** | **Angel Osana** | **Yumikolorenzooooo@smart.com** | **Smart Grocery Store** | **2** ⭐ |
| 10 | Angel Osana | dope020405@sment.com | EXO | 0 |

**⭐ Use Employer ID 9 to see the application!**

## Testing
I verified with a test script that:
- The query correctly finds 1 application
- The application is linked to Job ID 1 ("Senior Web Developer")
- The job belongs to Employer ID 9
- All data is properly loaded including applicant name "Alex Duhac"

Everything should be working now!
